    <h3>Background</h3>
    
    <p>
      In 2002, Nelson Mandela spoke at the AIDS Vaccine Conference in South Africa, delivering a powerful speech about the responsibility of all 
      people to support the health and well-being of children. He said:
      
    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; margin: 1em 0; padding-left: 1em; color: #333;">
      Giving children a healthy start in life, no matter where they are born or the circumstances of their birth,<br>
      is the moral obligation of every one of us. It is heartbreaking to think that three million children die each<br>
      year from diseases that we can prevent.<br><br>
      These are three million needless deaths every year. These are children that would have grown up to support<br>
      their families, their communities and their nations.<br><br>
      They would have been productive members of societies that are still developing and need their children to be<br>
      healthy and strong. By preventing these deaths, we would not only save the lives of children but we would also<br>
      help strengthen communities and contribute to the development of strong and prosperous nations.
    </blockquote>

    </p>  
    
    <p>
      Research supports Mandela’s assertions linking child health and community prosperity. According to a recent consensus study 
      report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine - Board on Children, Youth, and Families, adult health begins in 
      childhood, and improving the health of children has enormous societal gains (Chang, 2024). The report advocates for all children to receive 
      a healthy start in life. In the future, children will become caregivers of their own parents and children. Additionally, improving children's 
      health stems chronic disease progression. Many conditions experienced by adults, such as diabetes and obesity, begin in childhood. As such, 
      prevention efforts should start early in life. The authors also discuss the recent advances in health diagnostics and treatment, including 
      genomics and predictive personalized medicine, which lead to early detection and management of inherited and chronic conditions.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Nations experience greater productivity and economic gains when children are healthy (Chang, 2024). According to UNICEF (UNICEF, 2005), "child health and wellbeing 
      support the nation’s tax base, workforce, economic prosperity, and sustain a high standard of living." There are reduced costs of caring for 
      sick children. For example, when children are ill, parents miss work, play and rest, affecting their overall well-being and productivity. 
      Healthcare may also be expensive, resulting in an additional financial burden on the family.       
    </p> 

    <h3>Research Purpose and Aims</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this investigation is to explore characteristics of healthy children and aims to draw insights from the 2023
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch" target="_blank">National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)</a> 
      and 
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch" target="_blank">America's Health Rankings (AHR).</a> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      NSCH is a survey developed and administered annually by the U.S. Census Bureau with funding from the
      <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)</a>,
      <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB)</a>.
      This household survey began in 2003 and collects data on the physical and mental health of children 0–17 years old. All 50 states
      and the District of Columbia participate. The NSCH 2023 data are not available directly through an API, as users must agree to follow 
      the NSCH data use requirements. Instead, SAS, Stata, or CSV data files with corresponding codebooks can be downloaded from the 
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/help/dataset" target="_blank">Data Resource Center link</a> 
      and the 
      <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.html" target="_blank">US Census Bureau</a>. 
    </p> 

    <p>
      The 2023 NSCH includes the following topics:
      <ul> 
        <li>Demographics for the children and families</li>
        <li>Children’s physical and mental health status</li>
        <li>Health insurance status, adequacy, and type of coverage</li>
        <li>Access to and use of health care services</li>
        <li>Early childhood-specific information (0-5 years)</li>
        <li>Middle childhood and adolescent-specific information (6-17 years)</li>
        <li>Family health and activities</li>
        <li>Parental perceptions of neighborhood and community characteristics</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      Since 1990, the AHR has taken stock of the health and well-being of Americans each year by examining 280 measures of health from 80 distinct data sources. 
      Topics include:
      <ul> 
        <li>measures of care, such as access to care, preventative clinical care, quality of care,</li>
        <li>measures of health, such as mortality, nutrition and physical activity, physical health, sexual health, sleep health, smoking and tobacco use, behavioral health, </li>  
        <li>environmental factors, such as air and water quality and climate and health,</li> 
        <li>community characteristics, such as safety, economic resources, housing and transit,</li>
        <li>family characteristics, such as demographics, education, </li>
        <li> social support and engagement. </li>
      </ul>
          
      <br>    
      Data are available through the 
      <a href="https://developers.americashealthrankings.org/" target="_blank">AHR API</a>, which requires that users register and obtain an API 
      key. Data use is intended for non-commercial, educational, scientific, or charitable use. Additionally, attribution of source (AHR and any
      underlying data sources) is required in any output.
    </p>

    <p>
      NSCH and AHR data help communities and families make informed decisions to support the health and well-being of the children and youth in their
      care. Community-level data are available for participating areas, allowing them to compare their areas to neighboring communities, other 
      states and the nation. Local public health agencies, day-care centers and schools can use their results to evaluate their systems and 
      processes, gaining insights into where improvements can be made. These data also promote inter-agency cooperation for reform and lasting 
      change. For example, data sharing can encourage greater openness among schools, medical and mental-health providers, police and the courts. 
      Data from the NSCH and AHR are used for a variety of purposes. As such, a large body of reports and peer-reviewed publications are available. 
      NSCH publications include exploring aspects of overall child health, school-readiness, mental health and children with special needs. 
      A full list of NSCH publications authored by MCHB staff are available through the  
      <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data-research/national-survey-childrens-health/publications-presentations" target="_blank">NSCH Publications Page</a>. 
      AHR reports are available on their 
      <a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports" target="_blank">reports page</a>. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      This project explores the NSCH 2023 and AHR databases with machine learning techniques including regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees and 
      random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. Analyses are limited to state-level 
      comparisons and national estimates, as identifiers at the local level are not available on the NSCH public database.
    </p>  

    <p>The research questions explored by these analyses are below. State-level comparisons include the 50 states and District of Columbia (N=51). For state-level 
      comparisons, the NSCH is weighted using the sampling and response rate for the child and rolled up to the state level. Individual-level comparisons for the 
      NSCH are weighted with the sampling and response weights and include all respondents with non-missing values (N=54,159):
      <ol> 
        <li>What is the relationship between the percentage of households living below the federal poverty level (<b>AHR, 16184:poverty</b>) and children receiving 
          preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, state-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>)?</li>
        <li>What impact does the percentage of children who received by age 24 months all recommended vaccines (<b>AHR, 18114:vaccination</b>) have on children attaining very good or excellent 
          health (<b>NSCH, state-level, A1, excellent/very good versus good/fair/poor</b>, nomChHlthSt_23)?</li>
        <li>How does public health funding per person (<b>AHR, 3837:public health funding</b>) influence having continuous and adequate insurance (<b>NSCH, state level, E2/E3, insurance status, smAdeqIns_23</b>)? </li>
        <li>How does the number of active primary care providers per 100,000 population (<b>AHR, 17673:primary care provider</b>) relate to a child having a place to receive care regularly (<b>NSCH, state-level, 
          C8, place usually take child when sick, K4Q01</b>)? </li>
        <li>How does at least one preventative care visit (<b>NSCH, individual-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>) influence overall child health (<b>NSCH, individual-level, A1, 
          excellent/very good/good/fair/poor, K2Q01</b>)?</li>
        <li>What effect does having continuous and adequate insurance (<b>NSCH, individual-level, E2/E3, insurance status, smAdeqIns_23</b>) have on overall child health 
          (<b>NSCH, individual-level, A1, excellent/very good versus good/fair/poor, nomChHlthSt_23</b>)?</li>
        <li>How does family's poverty level (<b>NSCH, individual-level, K3, income, povlev4_23	(Income level based on family poverty level status, imputed) </b>) impact children receiving 
          preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, individual-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>)?</li>
        <li>What is the relationship between benefits from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program (<b>NSCH, individual-level, I7, Yes/No, WIC_23</b>)) and children receiving 
          preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, state-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>)? </li>
        <li>What impact does use of electronics (<b>NSCH, individual-level, H6, time spent in front of the TV/computer/cellphone playing games/social 
          media (not counting homework), ScreenTime_23</b>) have on whether child slept the average recommended number of hours for age (<b>NSCH, individual-level, H5, hours, HrsSleep_23
          (Child slept recommended age-appropriate hours during an average day/on most weeknights, age 4 months – 17)</b>)? </li>
        <li>Does moving two or more times in the last year (<b>NSCH, individual-level, I11, number of places lived in the last year greater than 2, PlacesLived_23</b>) influence children
          receiving preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, individual-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>) </li>
      </ol>
