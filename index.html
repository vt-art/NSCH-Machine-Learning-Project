    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This research aims to draw conclusions and insights from the
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch" target="_blank">
      National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)
      </a>,
      a survey developed and administered each year by the U.S. Census Bureau with funding from the
      <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)</a>,
      <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB)</a>.
      This household survey collects data on the physical and mental health of children 0–17 years old. All 50 states and the District of Columbia participate.
    </p> 

    <p>
    The NSCH includes the following topics:
      <ul> 
        <li>Demographics for the children and families</li>
        <li>Children’s physical and mental health status</li>
        <li>Health insurance status, adequacy, and type of coverage</li>
        <li>Access to and use of health care services</li>
        <li>Early childhood-specific information (0-5 years)</li>
        <li>Middle childhood and adolescent-specific information (6-17 years)</li>
        <li>Family health and activities</li>
        <li>Parental perceptions of neighborhood and community characteristics</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      According to a recent consensus study report, adult health begins in childhood and improving the health of children has enourmous societal gains (Chang, 2024). The report elaborates on seven of these gains, as follows:
      <ol> 
        <li>Every child deserves a healthy start in life</li>
        <li>According to UNICEF (2005), "child health and wellbeing support the nation’s tax base, workforce, economic prosperity, and sustain a high standard of living"</li>
        <li>When children are ill, parents miss work, play and rest, affecting their overall wellbeing and productivity.</li>
        <li>In the future, children will care for their parents.</li>
        <li>Many health conditions experienced by adults begin in childhood, and as such prevention starts early in life.</li>
        <li>Children may become parents when they are older, and healthy parents lead to healthier children.</li>
        <li>We are living in a time of great health advances with genomics and predictive personalized medicine. Our children can benefit from these advances.</li>
      </ol>           
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These data help communities and families make informed decisions to support the health and well-being of the children and youth in their care. Community-level data are available for participating areas, allowing them to compare their areas to their neighbors, other states and the nation. Local public health agencies, day-care centers and schools can use their results to evaluate their systems and processes, gaining insights into where improvements can be made. This survey also promotes inter-agency cooperation for reform and lasting change. For example, data can promote greater openness between schools, medical and mental-health providers, police and the courts.

      Data from the NSCH are used for a variety of purposes and as such a large body of reports and peer-reviewed publications are available. A full list of publications authored by MCHB staff are available through the

    <p> 
      This project explores the NSCH 2023 database with machine learning techniques including regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees and random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. This analysis is limited to state-level comparisons and national estimates, as identifiers at the local level are not available on the public database.
