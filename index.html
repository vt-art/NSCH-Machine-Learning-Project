    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This research aims to draw conclusions and insights from the
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch" target="_blank">
      National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)
      </a>
      , a survey developed and administered each year by the U.S. Census Bureau with funding from the
      <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">
      Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
      </a>
      <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">
      Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB)
      </a>
      . This household survey collects national- and state- estimates of the physical and mental health of children 0-17 years old. All 50 states and the District of Columbia participate. The NSCH includes the following topics:
      Demographics for the children and families 
      Children’s physical and mental health status
      Health insurance status, adequacy, and type of coverage 
      Access to and use of health care services 
      Early childhood-specific information (0-5 years) 
      Middle childhood and adolescent-specific information (6-17 years) 
      Family health and activities 
      Parental perceptions of neighborhood and community characteristics

      Community-level data are available for participating areas, allowing them to compare their areas to their neighbors, other states and the nation. Local public health agencies, day-care centers and schools can use their community results to honestly evaluate their systems and processes, gaining insights into where improvements can be made. This survey also promotes inter-agency cooperation for reform and lasting change. This analysis is limited to state-level comparisons and national estimates, as identifiers at the local level are not available on the public database.
      
      Data from the NSCH are used for a variety of purposes and as such a large body of reports and peer-reviewed publications are available.

  <p>
    This project explores various machine learning models applied to data from the 
    <strong>National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)</strong>. The dataset includes a wide range of variables
    related to children’s physical and mental health, family environment, and access to healthcare.
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary goal is to build and compare different models for classification, regression, clustering, and
    dimensionality reduction to extract meaningful insights and make predictions about child health outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Techniques explored include:
    <ul>
      <li>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</li>
      <li>Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical)</li>
      <li>Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)</li>
      <li>Classification (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks)</li>
      <li>Regression Analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    All models are evaluated based on accuracy, interpretability, and their relevance to public health insights.
