    <h1>Exploring Child Health with Data from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) and America's Health Rankings (AHR)</h1>
    
    <img src="Website_Pic2.JPG" alt="Introduction image">
    
    <h3>Background</h3>
    
    <p>
      In 2002, Nelson Mandela spoke at the AIDS Vaccine Conference in South Africa, delivering a powerful speech about the responsibility of all 
      people to support the health and well-being of children. He said:
      
    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #ccc; margin: 1em 0; padding-left: 1em; color: #333;">
      Giving children a healthy start in life, no matter where they are born or the circumstances of their birth,<br>
      is the moral obligation of every one of us. It is heartbreaking to think that three million children die each<br>
      year from diseases that we can prevent.<br><br>
      These are three million needless deaths every year. These are children that would have grown up to support<br>
      their families, their communities and their nations.<br><br>
      They would have been productive members of societies that are still developing and need their children to be<br>
      healthy and strong. By preventing these deaths, we would not only save the lives of children but we would also<br>
      help strengthen communities and contribute to the development of strong and prosperous nations.
    </blockquote> 

    </p>  
    
    <p>
      Research supports Mandela’s assertions linking child health and community prosperity. According to a recent consensus study 
      report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine - Board on Children, Youth, and Families, adult health begins in 
      childhood, and improving the health of children has enormous societal gains (Chang, 2024). The report advocates for all children to receive 
      a healthy start in life. In the future, children will become caregivers of their own parents and children. Additionally, improving children's 
      health stems chronic disease progression. Many conditions experienced by adults, such as diabetes and obesity, begin in childhood. As such, 
      prevention efforts should start early in life. The authors also discuss the recent advances in health diagnostics and treatment, including 
      genomics and predictive personalized medicine, which lead to early detection and management of inherited and chronic conditions.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Nations experience greater productivity and economic gains when children are healthy (Chang, 2024). According to UNICEF (UNICEF, 2005), "child health and wellbeing 
      support the nation’s tax base, workforce, economic prosperity, and sustain a high standard of living." There are reduced costs of caring for 
      sick children. For example, when children are ill, parents miss work, play and rest, affecting their overall well-being and productivity. 
      Healthcare may also be expensive, resulting in an additional financial burden on the family.       
    </p> 

    <h3>Research Purpose and Aims</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this investigation is to explore characteristics of healthy children and aims to draw insights from the 2023
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch" target="_blank">National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH)</a> 
      and 
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch" target="_blank">America's Health Rankings (AHR).</a> 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      NSCH is a survey developed and administered annually by the U.S. Census Bureau with funding from the
      <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)</a>,
      <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov" target="_blank">Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB)</a>.
      This household survey began in 2003 and collects data on the physical and mental health of children 0–17 years old. All 50 states
      and the District of Columbia participate.  
    </p> 

    <p>
      The 2023 NSCH includes the following topics:
      <ul> 
        <li>Demographics for the children and families</li>
        <li>Children’s physical and mental health status</li>
        <li>Health insurance status, adequacy, and type of coverage</li>
        <li>Access to and use of health care services</li>
        <li>Early childhood-specific information (0-5 years)</li>
        <li>Middle childhood and adolescent-specific information (6-17 years)</li>
        <li>Family health and activities</li>
        <li>Parental perceptions of neighborhood and community characteristics</li> 
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> 
      Since 1990, the AHR has taken stock of the health and well-being of Americans each year by examining 280 measures of health from 80 distinct data sources. 
      Topics include:
      <ul> 
        <li>measures of care, such as access to care, preventative clinical care, quality of care,</li>
        <li>measures of health, such as mortality, nutrition and physical activity, physical health, sexual health, sleep health, smoking and tobacco use, behavioral health, </li>  
        <li>environmental factors, such as air and water quality and climate and health,</li> 
        <li>community characteristics, such as safety, economic resources, housing and transit,</li>
        <li>family characteristics, such as demographics, education, </li>
        <li> social support and engagement. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      NSCH and AHR data help communities and families make informed decisions to support the health and well-being of the children and youth in their
      care. Community-level data are available for participating areas, allowing them to compare their areas to neighboring communities, other 
      states and the nation. Local public health agencies, day-care centers and schools can use their results to evaluate their systems and 
      processes, gaining insights into where improvements can be made. These data also promote inter-agency cooperation for reform and lasting 
      change. For example, data sharing can encourage greater openness among schools, medical and mental-health providers, police and the courts. 
      Data from the NSCH and AHR are used for a variety of purposes. As such, a large body of reports and peer-reviewed publications are available. 
      NSCH publications include exploring aspects of overall child health, school-readiness, mental health and children with special needs. 
      A full list of NSCH publications authored by MCHB staff are available through the  
      <a href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data-research/national-survey-childrens-health/publications-presentations" target="_blank">NSCH Publications Page</a>. 
      AHR reports are available on their 
      <a href="https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports" target="_blank">reports page</a>. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      This project explores the NSCH 2023 and AHR databases with machine learning techniques including regression, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees and 
      random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. Analyses are limited to state-level 
      comparisons and national estimates, as identifiers at the local level are not available on the NSCH public database.
    </p>  

    <p>The research questions explored by these analyses are below. State-level comparisons include the 50 states and District of Columbia (N=51). For state-level 
      comparisons, the NSCH is weighted using the sampling and response rate for the child and rolled up to the state level. Individual-level comparisons for the 
      NSCH are weighted with the sampling and response weights and include all respondents with non-missing values (N=54,159):

    <h3>Summary of findings</h3>
    
    <p>    
      At the state-level, increasing the percentage of children receiving at least one preventative care visit can improve their overall ability to identify adverse health conditions 
      in children early by getting them seen. Preventative visits also establish relationships with providers, which are crutial when children are ill.

    <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
    <p>
      <br>
      The NSCH 2023 data are not available directly through an API, as users must agree to follow 
      the NSCH data use requirements. Instead, SAS, Stata, or CSV data files with corresponding codebooks can be downloaded from the 
      <a href="https://www.childhealthdata.org/help/dataset" target="_blank">Data Resource Center</a> 
      and the 
      <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.html" target="_blank">US Census Bureau</a>. Due to these 
      requirements, the data are not stored directly on the GitHub page, as each user must agree to these conditions.
      <br>
      Once the NSCH 2023 CSV file was downloaded, the data were read into Python using the program
      <a href="https://github.com/vt-art/NSCH-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/code/1a_NSCH_family.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        1a_NSCH_family.
      </a>
       Identifiers and features of interst were kept. The NSCH data include FIPS codes for the states. New variables for the state long and short names were added. Missing codes of 95 and 99 
      were replaced with NAN. Records that were missing data for important analysis variables were removed, as the number missing relative to 
      the total is small, specifically:      
      <ul> 
        <li>overall health of the child (missing 131),</li>
        <li>preventative care (missing 457), </li>
        <li>place where take child when sick (missing 219),</li>
        <li>insurance (missing 348),</li>
        <li>poverty level not missing, as they used imputation</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Other variables that are missing more often are family WIC status (missing 1272), screen time (missing 749), and number places lived 
      in the last year (missing 1420). For analyses which include these variables, we will limit the analysis to non-missing responses, as 
      missing values are across all states and appear to be missing at random. Lastly, the program outputs a csv file (NSCH_fam.csv with 
      N=54,159 children).
      <br>
      Next, the child-level data (NSCH_fam.csv) are rolled-up to the state-level by calculating weighted proportions of the children with a 
      given response using the Python program
      <a href="https://github.com/vt-art/NSCH-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/code/1b_NSCH_state_data.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        1b_NSCH_state_data. 
      </a>
      A csv file with the state-level weighted proportions is output (NSCH_state.csv with 51 records (each of the 50 states and Washington DC)).
      
      <br>    
      The AHR data are available through the 
      <a href="https://developers.americashealthrankings.org/" target="_blank">AHR API</a>, which requires that users register and obtain an API 
      key. Data use is intended for non-commercial, educational, scientific, or charitable use. Additionally, attribution of source (AHR and any
      underlying data sources) is required in any output.<br>
      <br>
      The API was called using Python following the code  
      <a href="https://github.com/vt-art/NSCH-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/code/1c_AHR_API_and_state_data.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        1c_AHR_API_and_state_data. A csv file of the data was output (AHR_state.csv with 51 records).
      </a>
      <br>
      Finally, the NSCH and AHR state-level data were merged together and the csv of the combined data was output (NSCH_AHR_state.csv with 51 records) using the python program 
      <a href="https://github.com/vt-art/NSCH-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/main/code/1d_NSCH_AHR_combined_state_data.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        1d_NSCH_AHR_combined_state_data.
      </a>
      This datafile includes analysis variables, which are used in the data exploration and analysis.
      
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
   
    <p>
      As noted in the introduction, this research explored 10 questions. Results of the EDA for each question are provided below. As a reminder, state-level comparisons 
      included the 50 states and District of Columbia (N=51). For state-level comparisons, the NSCH was weighted using the sampling and response rate for the child and 
      rolled up to the state level. Individual-level comparisons for the NSCH are weighted with the sampling and response weights and include all respondents with non-missing
      values (N=54,159). 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Question 1: What is the relationship between the percentage of households living below the federal poverty level (<b>AHR, 16184:poverty</b>) and children receiving 
          preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, state-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>)?</b>
      <br><br>
      On average, states reported over 10% of households living below the federal poverty level (median(P25, P75) = 12.2(11.05,13.65)). The percentage of children 
      receiving at least one preventative care visit ranged from 69.8% to 89.3%. Figure 1 illustrates that as the percentage of households below the federal poverty 
      level increases (i.e. more people living in poverty), the percentage of children receiving preventative care decreases.<br>  
      <br>
      <b>Figure 1</b><br>
      <img src="images/Q1_preventative_care_Poverty_reg.png" alt="Q1 Preventative Care Poverty" width="1200"><br><br>
      
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>    
      <b>Question 2: What impact does the percentage of children who received by age 24 months all recommended vaccines (<b>AHR, 18114:vaccination, low versus medium or high coverage</b>) 
          have on children receiving preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, state-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>)?</b>
      <br><br>
      Median vaccine coverage was 67.7% across the states. If we considered < 67.5% as low coverage and 67.5% or greater as medium to high coverage, we see that the percentage 
      of children receiving at least one preventative care visit is slightly higher in the medium or high group. Specifically, in the low immunization group, a median 
      of 79.4% of children and for the medium or high group, a median of 80.9% of children received a preventative care visit. This suggests that preventative care may 
      play a role in childhood immunization coverage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 2</b><br>

    <br>
    <p>        
      <b>Question 3: How does public health funding per person (<b>AHR, 3837:public health funding</b>) influence number of active primary care providers per 100,000 population (<b>AHR, 
          17673:primary care provider</b>)?</b>
      <br><br>
      On average, states spend between $100-200 per capita on public health (median(P25, P75) = $123 (96.0, 156.5)). As shown in Figure 3, as per capita public health 
      spending increases, the number of active primary care providers per 100,000 people also increased.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 3</b><br>
      <img src="images/Q3_providers_public_health_reg_LT400.png" alt="Q3 Providers Public Health" width="1200"><br><br>
      Of note, Washington DC is excluded from Figure 4. DC has active providers per 100,000, and public health spending per capita in DC is $1,084.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>Question 4: How does the number of active primary care providers per 100,000 population (<b>AHR, 17673:primary care provider</b>) 
        relate to a child having a place to receive care regularly (<b>NSCH, state-level, C8, place usually take child when sick, K4Q01</b>)? </b>   
      <br><br>
      As the number of active primary care providers per 100,000 population increases, the percentage of children who have a regular place to 
      receive care also increases (Figure 4).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 4</b><br>
      <img src="images/Q4_place_for_care_providers_reg_LT450.png" alt="Q4 Place For Care Providers" width="1200"><br><br>
      Of note, Washington DC is excluded from Figure 4. DC has active providers per 100,000, and the percent of children in DC who have a place 
      to receive care regularly is 77.6%.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>  
      <b>Question 5: How does at least one preventative care visit (<b>NSCH, individual-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>) influence overall child health 
          (<b>NSCH, individual-level, A1, excellent/very good/good/fair/poor, K2Q01</b>)?</b>
      <br><br>
      Health status does not differ by whether a child had a preventative care visit. The proportion of children in each of the five health status groups appears 
      similar for those with and without preventative care (Figure 5).<br>

      <b>Question 6: What effect does having continuous and adequate insurance (<b>NSCH, individual-level, E2/E3, insurance status, smAdeqIns_23</b>) have on overall child health 
          (<b>NSCH, individual-level, A1, excellent/very good/good/fair/poor, nomChHlthSt_23</b>)?</b>
      <br><br>
      As the child'e health status worses from 'Excellent' to 'Poor', we see a trend with adequate insuance coverage decreasing. As shown in Figure 6, among those with 
      excellent health, 69% have adequate insurance. This drops to 45% having adequate insurance among those with poor health.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Question 7: How does family's poverty level (<b>NSCH, individual-level, K3, income, povlev4_23	(Income level based on family poverty level status, imputed) </b>) impact overall 
          child health (<b>NSCH, individual-level, A1, excellent/very good/good/fair/poor, nomChHlthSt_23</b>)?</b>
      <br><br>
      As overall health status decreases, the proportion of children at the highest income group (i.e. 400% or more of the poverty level) also decreases (Figure 7a). 
      The relationship between health status and poverty is also evaluated for those below the federal poverty level in Figure 7b and shows that as health worses more children
      are in families below the poverty level.<br>

      <b>Question 8: What is the relationship between benefits from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program (<b>NSCH, individual-level, I7, Yes/No, WIC_23</b>)) and overall child health 
          (<b>NSCH, individual-level, A1, excellent/very good/good/fair/poor, nomChHlthSt_23</b>)? </b>
      <br><br>
      The most vulnerable health groups are those children in the "good", "fair" and "poor" categories. We see that families that have support from WIC tend to be in the "good" and "fair" 
      categories and less so in the "poor" health category. <br>

      <b>Question 9: Among teenagers, what impact does use of electronics (<b>NSCH, individual-level, H6, time spent in front of the TV/computer/cellphone playing games/social 
          media (not counting homework), ScreenTime_23</b>) have on whether child slept the average recommended number of hours for age (<b>NSCH, individual-level, H5, hours, HrsSleep_23
          (Child slept recommended age-appropriate hours during an average day/on most weeknights, age 4 months – 17)</b>)? </b>
      <br><br>
      Limiting screen time appears to play a role for adequate hours of sleep for teenagers. Once the average hours of screen time exceed 1 hour per day, the weighted proportion of teens 
      experiencing inadequate sleep nearly doubles from 17% for 1 hour to 33% for 4 or more hours. <br>

      <b>Question 10: Does moving two or more times in the last year (<b>NSCH, individual-level, I11, number of places lived in the last year greater than 2, PlacesLived_23</b>) influence children
          receiving preventative care check-ups (<b>NSCH, individual-level, C1/C2, 1 or more visits versus no visits, PrevMed_23</b>) </b>
      <br><br>
      Children experiencing housing instability or living three or more places in the last year received a preventative care visit 69% of the time. Conversely, 80% of children who did not move more 
      than once experienced a preventative care visit.<br>
